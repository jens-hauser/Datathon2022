Customer information under the Swiss Insurance Contract Act (ICA)
The following customer information provides a concise overview of the insurer's identity and the material content of the insurance contract (Article 3 of the Swiss Insurance Contract Act – ICA). Only the insurance policy and General Terms and Conditions of Insurance (GTC) are authoritative for the content and scope of the rights and obligations derived from the insurance contract.


Who is the insurer?  
________________
What are the main exclusions?


  



The following list contains only the most important insurance cover exclusions. The exclusionary clauses «Non-insured events and benefits» of the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance as well as the ICA contain further exclusions:
* It is essentially the case that all insurance components do not provide insurance cover for events that had already occurred by the time of the signing of the contract, the booking of the journey or the commencement of the booked service; the same applies to events whose occurrence was recognisable at the time of the signing of the contract, the booking of the journey or the commencement of the booked service.
* Furthermore, there is no cover for such events as abuse of alcohol, drugs or medicines, suicide or attempted suicide, participation in strikes or unrest, participation in races or training sessions with motor vehicles or boats, participation in adventurous acts whereby the entitled person knowingly exposes him/herself to danger, negligent or premeditated actions/or failure to act.
* In addition, war, terror attacks, any type of unrest, epidemics, pandemics, natural catastrophes and incidents involving atomic, biological or chemical substances including the consequences thereof; the consequences of official decrees, e.g. confiscation of assets, imprisonment, ban on leaving the country or closure of air space are not insured.
* In respect of cover for cancellation charges / cancellation charges for accommodation and further training, in particular, no insurance cover exists in the event of "poor healing", inter alia i.e. for illnesses or the consequences of an accident, of an operation or of a medical intervention that already existed at the time of the booking of the journey or the signing of the insurance contract, and which had not fully healed by the time of the date of travel; the same applies to travel cancellations issued by the travel agency, official decrees, illnesses/injuries not immediately ascertained by a physician at the time of their occurrence, or to psychological responses to potential hazards, such as fear of unrest, terrorist attacks, natural catastrophes or aviophobia (fear of flying).


Which obligations are incumbent on the policyholder and insured persons?


  





The insurer is AWP P&C S.A., Saint-Ouen (Paris), Wallisellen Branch (Switzerland), hereinafter called Allianz Travel. The company headquarters are at Richtiplatz 1, 8304 Wallisellen.


Who is the policyholder?  




The policyholder is the person designated as such in the insurance policy. What risks are insured and what is the scope of the cover?  


The insured risks under the respective contract, scope of the cover and the cover restrictions are set out in the insurance policy and General Terms and Conditions of Insurance (GTC). The following is a summary of the various insurance components offered, provided for ease of understanding: Cancellation charges
* Assumption of the cancellation charges of the booked travel owed by the insured person, caused by an event that is listed as insured in the GTC.
Cancellation charges for accommodation and further training
* Assumption of the cancellation charges owed by the insured person, if this person is unable to take up the booking (holiday apartment, hotel, course, seminar) due to an event that is listed as insured in the GTC and cancels the booking.


Which persons are insured?  




In the case of insurance policies with a term of less than one year (short-term insurance policies), the persons listed in the insurance policy are insured. In the event of insurance policies with a term of one year (annual insurance policies), the insurance policy states whether the insurance cover applies for the policyholder alone (single person) or for the policyholder and the persons living with him/her in the same household as well as their minor children not living in the same household (family insurance policy).
The insured persons are in each case essentially set out in the insurance policy and the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance (GTC).


Temporal and local scope of the insurance cover  




The insurance cover basically applies worldwide during the insurance period. Local restrictions in the special provisions for the individual insurance components (e.g. breakdown and accident assistance applies only in Europe) as well as economic or trade sanctions or embargoes of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States of America or Switzerland that contradict the insurance cover remain reserved.
________________


The following list contains only the main obligations. Other obligations are set out in the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance and the ICA:
* For cancellation charges / cancellation charges for accommodation and further training the booking must be cancelled promptly at the travel company or accommodation/course provider on occurrence of the insured event. The claim must then be issued to Allianz Travel in writing and including the necessary documents (see GTC VB Section II A1 6 and GTC Section I 12 for contact address).
* In any event, the insured person is obliged to do everything to mitigate the loss and help resolve the claim; for losses caused by injury or illness, the insured person must ensure that the attending doctors are made exempt from their duty of confidentiality vis-à-vis Allianz Travel.
* If the entitled person is in breach of his/her duties, Allianz Travel can  withhold or reduce benefit payments.


How much is the premium?


  



The amount of the premium depends on the risks insured and stipulated level of cover. The amount of the premium is defined with the application and results from the insurance policy.


When does the insurance begin and end?


  



The beginning and end of the insurance are defined in the application and detailed in the insurance policy.
The insurance policies for a one-year term (annual insurance) are  automatically extended by a further year, provided neither the policyholder nor Allianz Travel issue notice in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail) subject to a three- month notice period.
Policies with a duration of less than a year (short-term insurance) lapse on the expiry date given in the application and insurance policy.
Insurance contracts can be terminated early by giving notice, particularly in the following instances:
* Following a claim resulting in the provision of benefits by the insurer, provided the notice given by the insurer occurred no later than the time of the payout or resolution of the case (e.g. assistance/legal support) or, by the policyholder, no later than 14 days from learning of the payment or resolution of the case.
* If the insurer changes the premiums. In this case, the insurer must receive the policyholder's termination notice no later than the last day prior to the premium amendment coming into effect.
* Termination by the insurer in the event of insurance fraud.
This list contains only the main causes for termination. There are others set out in the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance and the ICA.
Right of revocation
  



The policyholder may revoke the contract within a period of 14 days from the application to conclude the contract or the declaration of acceptance thereof by notifying the insurer in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail). The right of revocation is excluded for provisional cover commitments and contracts with a duration of less than one month.


How does Allianz Travel handle data?
  



When processing personal data essential to the transaction of insurance business, Allianz Travel observes the Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA). If necessary, Allianz Travel will obtain the necessary approval from the insured person through the claims form to process the data.
The personal data processed by Allianz Travel includes data relating to the conclusion of the contract and the policy/claims handling. The information
