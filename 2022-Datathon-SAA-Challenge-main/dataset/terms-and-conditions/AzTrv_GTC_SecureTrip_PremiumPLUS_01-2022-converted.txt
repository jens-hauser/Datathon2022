The following customer information provides a concise overview of the insurer's identity and the material content of the insurance contract (Article 3 of the Swiss Insurance Contract Act – ICA). Only the insurance policy and General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC) are authoritative for the content and scope of the rights and obligations derived from the insurance contract.

The insured risks under the respective contract, scope of the cover and the cover restrictions are set out in the insurance policy and General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC). The following is a summary of the various in- surance components offered, provided for ease of understanding:

Flight delay
* Assumption of the additional costs incurred for a hotel, rebooking or tele- phone calls if a connecting flight is missed due to a delay of at least three hours for which the first airline is solely responsible.
Health care costs abroad
* Assumption of health care costs for emergency medical interventions to treat illnesses or accidents suffered by the insured person while travelling abroad. The insurance is considered as a follow-up insurance to the statutory social insurance system (health insurance, accident insurance etc.) and to any supplememtary insurance policies. This cover only applies to persons up to their 81st birthday.
Collision damage waiver for rental vehicles (CDW)
* Assumption of the costs of the excess contractually owed by the insured person as a result of damage to the rental vehicle.

Pupil and student protection
* Assumption of the cancellation costs owed by the insured person in the event of cancellation of the booked trip as a result of a failure to move up a year, resitting of a failed examination or another event that is listed as insured in the GTC. In the event of unexpected cancellation during the stay abroad of study courses, work experience, research or seminars originally confirmed in writing or another event that is listed as insured in the GTC, the extra return journey will be organised and the related costs assumed instead of the benefits referred to above. This cover only applies to persons up to their 26th birthday.

Legal protection
* Assumption of legal protection exclusively in conjunction with trips under- taken outside Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein.


Which persons are insured?


  



In the case of insurance policies with a term of one year (annual insurance policies), the insurance policy states whether the insurance cover applies to the policyholder alone (single person) or to the policyholder and the persons living with him/her in the same household as well as their minor children not living in the same household (family insurance policy), provided these are accompanying an insured person and their permanent place of residence is in Switzerland. The insured persons are in each case essentially set out in the insurance policy and the General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC).


Temporal and geographical scope of the insurance cover


  



The insurance cover basically applies worldwide during the insurance period. Local restrictions in the special provisions for the individual insurance compo- nents as well as economic or trade sanctions or embargoes of the United Na- tions, the European Union, the United States of America or Switzerland that contradict the insurance cover remain reserved.


What are the main exclusions?
another person as a result of serious illness, a serious  accident, complica-                  tions of pregnancy or the unexpected worsening of a chronic illness.
Travel assistance
   * Organisation and assumption of the costs of the extra return journey, tem- porary return journey or onward journey for the insured person as a result of serious illness, a serious accident, death, complications of pregnancy or the unexpected worsening of a chronic illness of an accompanying person, a non-travelling person who is closely related to the insured person or the dep- uty at work or as a result of another insured event listed in the GTC.
Assistance in the event of death
   * Organisation and assumption of the costs of cremation outside the country of residence and return of the coffin or urn to the insured person’s last place of residence. In the event of local burial, the accommodation costs of ac- companying persons will be assumed instead of the benefits referred to above.

How much is the premium?        How does Allianz Travel treat data?

The beginning and end of the insurance are defined in the application and detailed in the insurance policy. Insurance policies with a one-year term (annual insurance policies) are automatically extended by a further year at the end of the one-year contract term, provided neither the policyholder nor Allianz Travel issue notice in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail) at the end of the term subject to a three-month notice period.
Insurance contracts can be terminated early by giving notice, particularly in the following instances:
   * following a claim event resulting in the provision of benefits by the insurer, provided the notice given by the insurer occurred no later than the time of the payout or resolution of the case (e.g. assistance/legal protection) or, by the policyholder, no later than 14 days after learning of the payment or resolution of the case;
   * if the insurer changes the premiums. In this case, the insurer must receive the policyholder's termination notice no later than the last day prior to the premium amendment coming into effect;
   * termination by the insurer in the event of insurance fraud.
This list contains only the main causes for termination. There are others set out in the General terms and conditions of insurance and the ICA.


Right of revocation
________________
When processing personal data essential to the transaction of insurance business, Allianz Travel observes the Swiss Data Protection Act (FADP). If necessary, Allianz Travel will use the claims form to obtain the necessary approval from the insured person to process the data.
The personal data processed by Allianz Travel includes data relating to the conclusion of the contract and the policy/claims handling. The information processed mainly comprises the policyholder's or insured person’s details from the insurance application and the claims statement. In the interests of all policyholders, data may also be exchanged with previous insurers and reinsurers within and outside Switzerland. Allianz Travel also processes personal data in connection with product enhancements as well as for its own marketing purposes.
In order to offer value-for-money comprehensive insurance cover, some of the benefits offered by Allianz Travel are provided by legally independent compa- nies both domestically and abroad. These may be Allianz Group companies or cooperation partners. For the purposes of fulfilling its contractual obligations, Allianz Travel must exchange data both within and outside the group.
Allianz Travel stores data electronically or physically in compliance with the legal provisions.
Persons whose data is processed by Allianz Travel have the right, in accord- ance with the Data Protection Act (DPA), to ask what data concerning them Allianz Travel actually processes; they may also request the rectification of incorrect data.


  



The policyholder may revoke the contract within a period of 14 days from the application to conclude the contract or the declaration of acceptance thereof by notifying the insurer in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail). The right of revocation is excluded for provisional cover commitments and contracts with a duration of less than one month.

In this case, Allianz Travel will inform the policyholder of the premium adjustment in writing at least 30 days before it comes into effect. The policyholder has the right to terminate the contract with effect from when the premium adjustment would apply. The policyholder’s termination of cover is valid, provided it is received by Allianz Travel no later than the last day before the premium adjustment comes into force.


            9. Multiple insurance and claims against third parties
A journey is a stay of over one day outside the person's normal place                  of residence or a stay of shorter duration at a location at least 30 km

________________
            19. In the event of (voluntary or mandatory) multiple insurance, Allianz Travel provides its benefits in a subsidiary capacity, subject to there being an identical clause in the other insurance contract. In such a case the legal provisions of double insurance apply.
            20. If an insured person is entitled to benefits under any other (voluntary or mandatory) insurance contract, cover is restricted to that part of the Allianz Travel benefits that exceeds the cover provided under the other insurance contract. Overall costs are reimbursed once only.
            21. If Allianz Travel provides benefits in spite of a subsidiarity situation, these benefits count as an advance and the insured person or benefi- ciary will cede his/her claims against the third party (voluntary or man- datory insurance) to Allianz Travel to the extent of those benefits.
            22. If the insured or entitled person has been compensated by a liable third party or the third party's insurer, any compensation due under this contract is rendered void.

               * the costs for the unused portion of the stay, pro rata to the insured price of the trip (without transport costs); the departure day counts as a used travel day.

               9.

any proceedings, conclude any settlement or initiate any legal measures without approval from CAP. The insured person must also submit all documents pertaining to the loss event to CAP. Should the insured person fail to fulfil these duties, CAP may withhold benefits. If the insured person does not comply with these obligations, CAP may refuse to pay benefits if the insured person does not prove that he/she was not at fault in the circumstances for the breach of these obligations or that the breach had no influence on the scope of the benefits owed by CAP.
                                                                                          3. If the involvement of an independent legal representative is required for court or administrative proceedings in accordance with applicable procedural law, or if there is a conflict of interest (two opposing parties insured with CAP or one insured person against an Allianz Group company), the insured person has a free choice of legal representative. If CAP does not accept the proposed legal representative, the insured person has the right to propose three other legal representatives from different law firms, one of which CAP is obliged to accept.
                                                                                          4. In the event of differences of opinion between the insured person and CAP regarding the measures to take by way of settlement of the loss event, the insured person may request a legal verdict on the matter from an arbitrator, selected by the insured person and CAP jointly.


                                                                                          6. Non-insured cases and benefits

                                                                                             2. In the event of disputes with the tax or customs authorities or in the event of proceedings due to contravention of tax or customs regulations (e.g. smuggling).
