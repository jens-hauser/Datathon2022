Which persons are insured?

In the case of insurance policies with a term of less than one year (short-term 
insurance policies), the persons listed in the insurance policy are insured. In 
the event of insurance policies with a term of one year (annual insurance 
policies), the insurance policy states whether the insurance cover applies for 
the policyholder alone (single person) or for the policyholder and the persons 
living with him/her in the same household as well as their minor children not 
living in the same household (family insurance policy).
The insured persons are in each case essentially set out in the insurance 
policy and the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance (GTC).
