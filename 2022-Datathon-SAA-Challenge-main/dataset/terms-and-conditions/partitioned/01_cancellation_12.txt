Right of revocation

The policyholder may revoke the contract within a period of 14 days from the 
application to conclude the contract or the declaration of acceptance thereof by 
notifying the insurer in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail). The right of revocation is 
excluded for provisional cover commitments and contracts with a duration of 
less than one month.
