8. Premium adjustment (annual insurance)

Allianz Travel reserves the right to amend premiums for annual 
insurance and is accordingly entitled to request the amendment of the 
insurance contract. In this case, Allianz Travel shall inform the 
policyholder of the premium adjustment in writing at least 30 days 
before it comes into effect. The policyholder has the right to terminate 
the contract with effect from when the premium adjustment would 
apply. The policyholderâ€™s termination of cover is valid, provided it is 
received by Allianz Travel no later than the last day before the 
premium adjustment comes into force.
