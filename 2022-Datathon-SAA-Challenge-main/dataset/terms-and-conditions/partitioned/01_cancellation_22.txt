9. Multiple insurance and claims against third parties

9.1 For (voluntary or compulsory) multiple insurance, AG provides its 
services in a subsidiary capacity, subject to there being an identical 
clause in the other insurance contract. In such a case the legal 
provisions of double insurance apply.
9.2 If an insured person is entitled to benefits under any other insurance 
contract (voluntary or mandatory), cover is restricted to that part of the 
Allianz Travel benefits that exceeds the cover provided under the other 
insurance contract. Overall costs are reimbursed once only.
9.3 If Allianz Travel provides benefits in spite of a subsidiarity situation, 
these benefits count as an advance and the insured person or 
beneficiary will cede his/her claims against the third party (voluntary or 
mandatory insurance) to Allianz Travel to the extent of those benefits.
9.4 If the insured or entitled person has been compensated by a liable third 
party or the third party's insurer, any compensation due under this 
contract is rendered void. If a claim is made against Allianz Travel
instead of the liable party, the insured or entitled person must concede 
his/her liability claims up to the extent of the compensation received 
from Allianz Travel.
