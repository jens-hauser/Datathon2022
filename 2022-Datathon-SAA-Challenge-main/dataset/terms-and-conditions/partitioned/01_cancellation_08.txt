What are the main exclusions?

The following list contains only the most important insurance cover 
exclusions. The exclusionary clauses «Non-insured events and benefits» of 
the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance as well as the ICA contain 
further exclusions:
− It is essentially the case that all insurance components do not provide 
insurance cover for events that had already occurred by the time of the 
signing of the contract, the booking of the journey or the commencement of 
the booked service; the same applies to events whose occurrence was 
recognisable at the time of the signing of the contract, the booking of the 
journey or the commencement of the booked service.
− Furthermore, there is no cover for such events as abuse of alcohol, drugs or 
medicines, suicide or attempted suicide, participation in strikes or unrest, 
participation in races or training sessions with motor vehicles or boats, 
participation in adventurous acts whereby the entitled person knowingly 
exposes him/herself to danger, negligent or premeditated actions/or failure to 
act.
− In addition, war, terror attacks, any type of unrest, epidemics, pandemics, 
natural catastrophes and incidents involving atomic, biological or chemical 
substances including the consequences thereof; the consequences of official 
decrees, e.g. confiscation of assets, imprisonment, ban on leaving the 
country or closure of air space are not insured.
− In respect of cover for cancellation charges / cancellation charges for 
accommodation and further training, in particular, no insurance cover 
exists in the event of "poor healing", inter alia i.e. for illnesses or the 
consequences of an accident, of an operation or of a medical intervention 
that already existed at the time of the booking of the journey or the signing of 
the insurance contract, and which had not fully healed by the time of the date 
of travel; the same applies to travel cancellations issued by the travel 
agency, official decrees, illnesses/injuries not immediately ascertained by a 
physician at the time of their occurrence, or to psychological responses to 
potential hazards, such as fear of unrest, terrorist attacks, natural 
catastrophes or aviophobia (fear of flying).
