3. Extension of the insurance cover (annual insurance)

3.1 Annual insurance applies for one year from the inception date given in 
the insurance policy. Unless otherwise specified in Section I 3.2, they 
are extended automatically every year, provided the policyholder or 
Allianz Travel do not issue notice in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail) valid 
three months in advance from the insurance expiry date.
3.2 If the policyholder moves abroad during the contract term, the contract 
will lapse on the expiry date following the change of domicile. From 
the date of changing domicile, the insurance cover only applies for 
trips booked in Switzerland until the insurance expiry date.
