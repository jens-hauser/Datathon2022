Which obligations are incumbent on the policyholder and insured 
persons?

The following list contains only the main obligations. Other obligations are set 
out in the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance and the ICA:
− For cancellation charges / cancellation charges for accommodation and 
further training the booking must be cancelled promptly at the travel 
company or accommodation/course provider on occurrence of the insured 
event. The claim must then be issued to Allianz Travel in writing and 
including the necessary documents (see GTC VB Section II A1 6 and GTC 
Section I 12 for contact address).
− In any event, the insured person is obliged to do everything to mitigate the 
loss and help resolve the claim; for losses caused by injury or illness, the 
insured person must ensure that the attending doctors are made exempt 
from their duty of confidentiality vis-à-vis Allianz Travel.
− If the entitled person is in breach of his/her duties, Allianz Travel can 
withhold or reduce benefit payments.
