Temporal and local scope of the insurance cover

The insurance cover basically applies worldwide during the insurance period. 
Local restrictions in the special provisions for the individual insurance 
components (e.g. breakdown and accident assistance applies only in Europe) 
as well as economic or trade sanctions or embargoes of the United Nations, 
the European Union, the United States of America or Switzerland that 
contradict the insurance cover remain reserved.
