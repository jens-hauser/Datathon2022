When does the insurance begin and end?

The beginning and end of the insurance are defined in the application and 
detailed in the insurance policy.
The insurance policies for a one-year term (annual insurance) are 
automatically extended by a further year, provided neither the policyholder nor 
Allianz Travel issue notice in text form (e.g. letter, e-mail) subject to a threemonth notice period.
Policies with a duration of less than a year (short-term insurance) lapse on the 
expiry date given in the application and insurance policy.
Insurance contracts can be terminated early by giving notice, particularly in the 
following instances:
− Following a claim resulting in the provision of benefits by the insurer, 
provided the notice given by the insurer occurred no later than the time of the 
payout or resolution of the case (e.g. assistance/legal support) or, by the 
policyholder, no later than 14 days from learning of the payment or resolution 
of the case.
− If the insurer changes the premiums. In this case, the insurer must receive 
the policyholder's termination notice no later than the last day prior to the 
premium amendment coming into effect.
− Termination by the insurer in the event of insurance fraud.
This list contains only the main causes for termination. There are others set 
out in the General Terms and Conditions of Insurance and the ICA.
