medical intervention had already occurred by the time the trip was 
booked or the insurance was concluded and have failed to heal by the

If the travel company is unable to fulfil its contractual services either fully 
or in part, cancels the trip or has to cancel due to specific circumstances 
and is obliged, according to the relevant legal provisions, to pay 
compensation for those services not provided. Specific circumstances 
necessitating cancellation of the trip include (inter alia) 
recommendations by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs not to 
travel to the area in question.
5.4 Official decrees
If official decrees render the planned completion of the booked journey 
impossible.
