How does Allianz Travel handle data?

marketing purposes.
In order to offer value-for-money comprehensive insurance cover, some of the 
services offered by Allianz Travel are provided by legally independent 
companies both domestically and abroad. These may be Allianz Group 
companies or cooperation partners. For the purposes of fulfilling its contractual 
obligations, Allianz Travel must exchange data both within and outside the 
group.

legal provisions.
