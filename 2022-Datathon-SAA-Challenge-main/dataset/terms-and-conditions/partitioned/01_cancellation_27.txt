3. Insurance benefits

3.1 Cancellation charges
If the insured person cancels the contract with the travel company due 
to an insured event, Allianz Travel will pay the contractual cancellation 
charges up to the contractually specified insured amount. Any costs 
invoiced to the insured person for rebooking incurred prior to the 
cancellation will only be covered if the rebooking is due to an insured 
event as defined under Section II A1 4. There is no compensation for 
costs, fees or credit reductions resulting from the loss or forfeiture of 
air miles, prize awards or other rights of use (time-sharing etc.).
3.2 Delayed departure
If the insured person starts the trip late due to an insured event, 
instead of paying the cancellation charges, Allianz Travel will pay (up 
to the equivalent amount of the cancellation charges):
− The additional travel costs arising from the delayed departure;
− The costs for the unused portion of the stay, proportionally to the 
insured arrangement price (without transport costs); the departure 
day counts as a used day.
3.3 Expenses incurred for disproportionate or recurrent handling charges 
or insurance premiums are not reimbursed.
3.4 Cover for tickets to events
If the insured person is unable to use a ticket to an event due to an 
insured occurrence, the associated costs are covered. The definition 
of a journey under Section I 7.6 does not apply.
