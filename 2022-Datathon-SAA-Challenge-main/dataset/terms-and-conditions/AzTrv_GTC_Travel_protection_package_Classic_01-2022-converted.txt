Customer information under the Swiss Insurance Contract Act (ICA)


The following customer information provides a concise overview of the insurer's identity and the material content of the insurance contract (Article 3 of the Swiss Insurance Contract Act – ICA). Only the insurance policy and General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC) are authoritative for the content and scope of the rights and obligations derived from the insurance contract.


Who is the insurer?  




The insurer is AWP P&C S.A., Saint-Ouen (Paris), Wallisellen Branch (Switzerland), hereinafter referred to as Allianz Travel. The company headquarters are at Richtiplatz 1, 8304 Wallisellen.


Who is the policyholder?

The insured risks under the respective contract, scope of the cover and the cover restrictions are set out in the insurance policy and General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC). The following is a summary of the various in- surance components offered, provided for ease of understanding:
Cancellation costs
* Assumption of the cancellation costs owed by the insured person if the booked trip is cancelled as a result of serious illness, a serious accident, death or another event that is listed as insured in the GTC. If the trip starts late due to an insured event, the additional costs of the trip will be assumed and any missed part of the stay will be covered (max. up to the equivalent to the cancellation costs) instead of the benefits referred to above.
Medical assistance
* Organisation and assumption of the costs of transfer to the nearest hospital, repatriation under medical supervision to a hospital near the place of resi- dence, the extra return journey without medical accompaniment to the place of residence, supervision of any accompanying minors or a hospital visit for another person as a result of serious illness, a serious accident, complica- tions of pregnancy or the unexpected worsening of a chronic illness.
Travel assistance
* Organisation and assumption of the costs of the extra return journey, tem- porary return journey or onward journey for the insured person as a result of serious illness, a serious accident, death, complications of pregnancy or the unexpected worsening of a chronic illness of an accompanying person, a non-travelling person who is closely related to the insured person or the deputy at work or as a result of another insured event listed in the GTC.
Assistance in the event of death
* Organisation and assumption of the costs of cremation outside the country of residence and return of the coffin or urn to the insured person’s last place of residence. In the event of local burial, the accommodation costs of ac- companying persons will be assumed instead of the benefits referred to above.
________________
Search and rescue costs
* Assumption of search and rescue costs abroad if during the journey the insured person is deemed to be missing or needs to be rescued from a physical emergency.
Flight delay
* Assumption of the additional costs incurred for a hotel, rebooking or tele- phone calls if a connecting flight is missed due to a delay of at least three hours for which the first airline is solely responsible.


Which persons are insured?


  



In the case of insurance policies with a duration of less than one year (short- term insurances), the persons listed in the insurance policy are insured. The insured persons are in each case essentially set out in the insurance policy and the General terms and conditions of insurance (GTC).


Temporal and geographical scope of the insurance cover

What are the main exclusions?


  



The following list contains only the most important insurance cover exclusions. Further exclusions are contained in the exclusionary clauses «Non-insured events and benefits» of the General terms and conditions of insurance as well as the ICA:

            3. Insured events

            * the insured person;
            * a closely related person who booked the same event and can- celled;
            * a non-travelling person who is closely related to the insured person;
            * the deputy at work, provided the insured person's presence is indispensable.
If a number of insured persons have booked the same trip, it can be cancelled for a maximum of six persons if an accompanying insured person cancels the trip due to one of the above events.
            2. For mental illness, insurance cover only applies if
            * a psychiatrist confirms an inability to work and travel and
            * the inability to work is documented by a certificate of absence sup- plied by the employer.
            3. Chronic illness is only covered by the insurance if the trip has to be cancelled due to a medically documented, unexpected, acute deterioration. Cover is contingent on the person being able to travel at time of booking or taking out the insurance and demonstrably being in a stable state of health.
            2. Pregnancy
In the event of the insured or an accompanying person becoming pregnant, insurance cover only applies if this occurred after the trip was booked or the insurance was taken out and the date of the return journey is after the 24th week of pregnancy or if the pregnancy occurred subsequent to booking the trip or concluding the insurance and a vaccination was required for the destination, which would pose a risk to the unborn child.
            3. Quarantine
If the insured person or a travelling companion is quarantined before their trip by order or other requirement of a government or public authority, based on their suspicion that the insured person or a travelling companion, specifically, has been exposed to a contagious disease (including an epidemic or a pandemic disease such as e. g. COVID-19). This does not include any quarantine that applies generally or broadly to some or all of a population or geographical area, or that applies based on where the person is travelling to, from or through.
            4. Damage to property at the place of residence
If the insured person's property is seriously damaged at his/her place of residence due to theft, fire, water or natural hazards and he/she has to be present at home as a result.
            5. Delay or lack of public transport for the outward journey
If the booked trip cannot begin due to the delay or cancellation of the public transport used for the outward journey to the starting point arranged for travel purposes.
            6. Failure of vehicle on the outward journey as a result of breakdown or accident
If the private vehicle or taxi used for the outward journey to the starting point arranged for travel purposes becomes unusable due to a break- down or accident during the actual journey. Problems with keys and fuel are not insured.
            7. Strike
If a strike (excluding strikes by the travel company or its service providers) makes the trip impossible.
            8. Danger at the destination
